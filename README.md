# 0009_ASampleCodeWithLoops

I did a sample code relevant to loops.

# Sample Exercise

### Write a program which reads a set of numbers, until the EOF, from standart input (stdin) and prints the number of items read from stdin and the sum of the squares of these numbers, excluding the numbers that are divided by 2 and 5, evenly; or prime numbers.

**_input: set of integers_**

**_output: # of items read;space character;sum of the squares of the numbers_**

*For example:*
--

**_for the following input:_**

>Sample Input: 2 4 3 10 13 8 9 191

**_your program first prints 8, since there are 8 items read from the stdin and must calculate and print the sum of the squares, excluding  2,3,10,13,191 as follows:  4*4+8*8+9*9_**

>Output: 8 161

**_Suggestion: Prepare sample input files, i.e. input.txt, to test your program. Assume that your executable is lab3.exe. Test your programs like this:_**
**_>./sampleCode.exe <input.txt_**

**_Please, PAY ATTENTION TO THE I/O FORMAT._**
